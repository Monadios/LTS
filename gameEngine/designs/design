Sequences are collections of characters, animations, dialguoe, subtitles, camera movements, events, scripts and prerendered cutscenes in a timeline file. They are essentially clips that make up an entire scene.

A scene is a collection of sequences in a larger timeline file.

Sequences can also access the scene timeline to see how far into the whole scene it is.

examples

if :has_looked_at object_id then
   do
	:setvalue camseq3 :load_sequence "X1bb_12_CamSeq3" 
	:run_sequece camseq3
   done

else
   do
	SayDialogue "Dialogue3"
	#SayDialogue will asynchronsly overwrite whatever dialogue (sound and subtitles) is currently running and instead display the selected file

	choice = DisplayChoice "Choice3"

	#choices suspends any mouse input (or possibly loads a input configuration file) and plays a sequence, while displaying a user input dialogue and waiting for the answer.
   	if :choice_is choice "choice_posibility1" then
	   do
		...
	   done
   done
end

=========================

Each script would be handed a reference of the world and would as such be free to change it. This is problematic for asynchrous scripts (fix).

The above script would be included in a sequence file and would therefore the final result is a animation and writing studio with integrated scripting features.
