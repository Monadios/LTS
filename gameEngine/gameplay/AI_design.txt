AI should be based on "facts" and a logical thinking system (LTS)

facts in this context is a piece of data which the ai has in it's memory

examples:
	spotting a door left open
	seeing the same person wearing different disguises
	remembering faces


this means that if you are spotted wearing one disguise and change, the AI will look for the other disguise.
However if anyone saw your face, they would spot you easier than those who didn't

Ai's also have "expectations" (i.e facts that they expect like a waiter not carrying a gun).

Ai should also exhibit varying levels of awareness.

awareness determines both how fast ai picks up (stores) facts and how
much attention is payed to discrepancies between facts and expectations.

AI have different states:
   idle = everything is fine (awareness low)
   suspicious = the facts that they observe don't match what they think should happen (awareness medium)
   alerted = they figured out something is wrong based on facts (awareness high)


Ai's have different senses.

senses are input systems to the LTS.

facts and expectations should perhaps be categorized by sense i.e
sight expectation, auditory, etc.
