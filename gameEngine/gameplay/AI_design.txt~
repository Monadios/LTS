AI should be based on "facts"


facts in this context is a piece of data which the ai has in it's memory

examples:
	spotting a door left open
	seeing the same person wearing different disguises
	remembering faces


Ai should also exhibit varying levels of awareness

awareness determines both how fast ai picks up (stores) facts and how much attention is payed to facts (i.e how much they care)
